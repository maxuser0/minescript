r"""pyeval v5.0 distributed via Minescript jar file

Usage:
  \pyeval <pythonCode> [<line2> [<line3> ...]]

Executes <pythonCode> (and optional subsequent lines
<line2>, <line3>, etc) as either a Python expression (code that
can appear on the right-hand side of an assignment, in which
case the value is echoed to the chat screen) or Python
statements (e.g. a `for` loop).

Functions from minescript.py are available automatically without
qualification.

Examples:
  Print information about nearby entities to the chat screen:
  \pyeval "entities()"

  Print the names of nearby entities to the chat screen:
  \pyeval "for e in entities(): echo(e['name'])"

  Import `time` module, sleep 3 seconds, and take a screenshot:
  \pyeval "import time" "time.sleep(3)" "screenshot()"

# `from ... import *` is normally considered poor form because of namespace

# Python code that's entered in the Minecraft chat screen to omit the module
# prefix for brevity. And brevity is important for this use case.
